This project is built on top of the 1.8.9 Forge Template and is designed to automatically run Hypixel Skyblock on multiple Minecraft accounts using Forge and MultiMC.
This is the newest full revamp of the original project.
The older version still exists in the /old folder and remains fully functional, but this new version is significantly cleaner, faster, and uses far better programming techniques. Development spans 2024–early 2025.

🔄 Project Background
This project is a complete rewrite of my earlier repository:
autoskyblock-minecraft-java-scripting-mod
https://github.com/IRennie74/autoskyblock-minecraft-java-scripting-mod
The new version improves on the original in almost every way:
- Cleaner and more maintainable code
- Better structure and organization
- More reliable automation
- More modern programming practices

One mistake I made in the original project was not writing a proper README with installation instructions or a clear explanation of how the system works. I’m fixing that now—without rewriting the entire codebase again just for documentation.

✨ Features
Reliability & Safety Systems
These systems ensure long‑term stability and uninterrupted operation:
- Server change detection
- Disconnection detection
- Automatic reconnection
- Automatic script restart on error
- False block detection

Automation Scripts
Built‑in automation modes include:
- Side‑to‑side farming
- Side‑to‑side farming with forward/backward movement
- Cobblestone mining automation
- Automatic crafting
- Custom user‑defined scripts

Keystroke & Movement Recording
A full input‑tracking system allows users to create highly accurate custom scripts:
- Records keyboard input every 5 ms
- Tracks mouse movement and player motion
- Replays actions with high precision
- Supports logic layers such as warping, server switching, and more

📁 Project Status
- Old version: Fully functional, stored in /old
- New version: Cleaner, faster, actively improved
Both versions share most of the same capabilities, but the new version is far more maintainable.

If you want, I can also add:
- Installation instructions
- Setup steps for MultiMC
- Example scripts
- Architecture diagrams
- A troubleshooting section
- A “How it works internally” explanation
Just tell me what direction you want the README to go.
